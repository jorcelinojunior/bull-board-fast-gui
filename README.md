## Quick Start

You can run Bull Board Fast GUI directly using `npx` without needing to install it in your project.

### Example

To visualize and manage multiple queues (`torrents`, `movie-processed`, `movie-unprocessed`, `image-movie`) with a Redis server running locally:

```bash
BULL_CONNECTION=redis://localhost:6379 \
BULL_QUEUES=torrents,movie-processed,movie-unprocessed,image-movie \
BULL_PORT=3000 \
npx bull-board-fast-gui
```

### Environment Variables

Before running Bull Board Fast GUI, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `BULL_CONNECTION`: The Redis connection string (default: `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`)
- `BULL_QUEUES`: A comma-separated list of queue names (default: `messages`)
- `BULL_UI_BASE_PATH`: The base path for the UI (default: `/admin/queues`)
- `BULL_PORT`: The port on which the dashboard will run (default: `3000`)

### Running the Dashboard

To run the dashboard, simply use the following command:

```bash
BULL_CONNECTION=redis://localhost:6379 \
BULL_QUEUES=torrents,movie-processed,movie-unprocessed,image-movie \
BULL_PORT=3000 \
npx bull-board-fast-gui
```

Then visit the dashboard in your browser:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/admin/queues
```

Example:
```bash
